		    	<h2>What Should I Launder?</h2>
		    	<p class="faqText">
		    		Laundry is ideal for cotton dress shirts, as well as other cotton clothing. However, many other types of materials can also be laundered. With laundry the colors of your clothes will fade daster over time, however it is ideal for cleaning very dirty items. This is because laundry uses water as it's cleaning agent, which is superior for removing surface level stains and grime.

		        <h2>What Should I Dry Clean?</h2>
		    	<p class="faqText">
		    		Dry cleaning is the superior cleaning method to keep your clothes looking the way they did when you bough them for longer. This is because of the way dry cleaning works. Your clothes are bathed in a solvent, which there are many types of out there, then heated rapidly so the solvent evaporates clinging to any oils, stains, or other types of grime and removing them. This is why dry cleaning is used with more difficult stains that laundry cannot remove. We are able to put additives onto stains that will cling on and remove the stain when evaporating. Dry cleaning should be done for dresses, suits, dress pants, delicate blouses, and more. If your garment has a care label with a circle on it, that means it is recommended to dry clean it.
